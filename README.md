# demo-binder
Repository that serves as a test run for a Binder powered by Jupyter Notebooks.

[Binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jannhs/demo-binder/HEAD) 


### Packages required
[pip-compile](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/) is used to lock down the versions of all of the packages that the Python code relies on. The list is written on 'requirements.txt'

### More
As an addendum, the Binder could also work while using a C code implementation from another public repository.
